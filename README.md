* Over all, looks great, color is the same as required, the picture for the card looks sized correctly.  Over all good job
* Great on the shadow and radii for the corners
* Need to change the font size for the Publish 21 section
* Maybe add some margin / padding between Published and HTML sections
* Maybe removed some margin / padding between <p> tag and footer picture and Name
